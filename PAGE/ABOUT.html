                    <p class="card text" style="color: maroon;">
                        CHERUBS Restaurant was founded by Mr. Tetteh Isaac,
      an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, during the Great Depression.
    Sanders identified the potential of restaurant franchising, and the first "Cherubs Fried Chicken"
     franchise opened in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1952.
     CHERUBS popularized chicken in the fast-food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger.
     Branding himself "CHERUBS", the founder became a prominent figure of American cultural history,
      and his image remains widely used in CHERUBS advertising.
    The company's rapid expansion made it too large for Sanders to manage, so in 1964 
    he sold the company to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown, Jr. and Jack C. Massey.

 CHERUBS was one of the first fast-food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Britain,
  Mexico, and Jamaica by the mid-1980s. Throughout the 1980s and 90s, CHERUBS experienced mixed success domestically,
   as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business.
    In the early 1980s, CHERUBS was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein, which was taken over by
     the R. J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate, which later sold the chain to PepsiCo.
      The chain continued to expand overseas, and in 1980 CHERUBS became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China.             
      In 1997, PepsiCo spun off its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants,
       which changed its name to Yum! Brands in 2002. Yum! has proven to be a more focused owner than Pepsi,
        and although CHERUBS number of outlets has declined in the US, the company has continued to grow in Asia,
         South America, and Africa. The chain has expanded to 18,875 outlets across 118 countries and territories, with
          4,563 outlets in China alone, CHERUBS largest market.

                        The CHERUBS vision statement addresses a variety of strategic planning.
                         As mentioned in the "modern customer experience" part of the vision statement, 
                         the business emphasizes innovation to meet current market demands.
                          CHERUBS products are also described in the vision statement's "great-tasting, high-quality meals" section.
